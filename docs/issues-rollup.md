# Issue Rollup: Master + Epics 1 & 2

This file is generated by `issue_rollup.py`. Provide the issue numbers and run:

```
python3 issue_rollup.py --master <MASTER_NUM> --epic1 <EPIC1_NUM> --epic2 <EPIC2_NUM>
```

It will assemble the master issue, Epic 1, and Epic 2 and list any open sub-issues referenced in their task lists or bodies. It also groups items into “Needs HPC”, “Cloud OK”, and “Needs Triage” using lightweight heuristics (labels and keywords). Review classifications and adjust labels as needed.
